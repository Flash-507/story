Step-1: create your project folder, CD into it
ex: ~ 'mkdir <project>'
    ~ 'cd <project>'

step-2: use command git init, to create a git local repository, which tracks the changes in the folder.
ex: ~ git init

step-3: To track changes to a file, add file to staging area.
ex: ~ 'git status' : it displays files which are in staging area or not.
    ~ 'git add <filename.ext>' : it adds the file to staging area.
    ~ 'git add .' : shortcut for multiple files to be added/updated.

step-4: git commit, use this command to add files from staging area to start tracking.
ex: ~ 'git commit -m "<message>"'

step-5: to check all the prev commits, use git log command
ex:  ~ "git log"

step-6: compare a file by using "git diff <filename.ext>", it compares current updated file(not committed) to commited file
ex:  ~ 'git diff chapter3.txt'

step-7: to revert or roll back to committed file, use git checkout <filename.ext>.
ex:  ~ 'git checkout chapter3.txt'
